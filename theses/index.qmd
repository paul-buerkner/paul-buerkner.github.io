In our lab, we have open topics for Bachelor and Master theses throughout the
entire academic year. Most of them are part of one of our larger 
[research projects](../projects). Below, you can find a short description of some
selected topics. If one of the them sounds interesting to you, please contact the person
mentioned under *Supervision* (just click on their name to be forwarded
to their profile) and put me in CC. In your email, please don't forget to provide
some basic information about yourself, including your field of study,
programming skills, and completed courses that you think may be relevant.
If you none of the topics below fits your interests,
but you still want to write your thesis with us, please contact me directly. We are also
open for your own ideas should they be something we can properly supervise.

Tools: Python, TensorFlow

Problem description: In our *parametric prior learning* method (i.e., learning the hyperparameters of a prior distribution family) we observe that the optimization is sensitive to the initial values. Specifically, if too "bad" initial values are used optimization might get stuck in a local minimum or learning takes extremely long. 

Project structure:

1. Literature research on initial value problems and methods
2. Implement 1-3 methods (depending on their complexity)
3. Run simulation studies
4. Analyse and discuss results
