## What I Do

<!-- TODO: add more internal and external links -->

I am a statistician with a focus on probabilistic (Bayesian) methods currently
working as a Junior Research Group Leader for Bayesian Statistics at the Cluster
of Excellence SimTech, University of Stuttgart. Soon, I will become Full
Professor for Computational Statistics at the Department of Statistics, TU
Dortmund University. Having originally studied psychology and mathematics, my
[core research](../research/) is nowadays located somewhere between statistics
and machine learning, with applications in almost all quantitative sciences.

The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle
uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using
probability theory. Thus, it should not come as a surprise that Bayesian methods
are increasingly used in statistical and computational inference in both science
and industry. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and
fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding
constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining
challenges in computation. In [my lab](../people), we are working on a wide
range of [research topics](../research/) related to the development, evaluation,
implementation, or application of Bayesian methods. This includes, among others,
uncertainty quantification, prior specification, simulation-based inference, as
well as model evaluation and comparison.

If you are a scientist who wants to collaborate with me, a PhD or PostDoc
candidate interested in my research, or a student looking for a thesis topic,
please [reach out to me](mailto:paul.buerkner@gmail.com)!
