I am a statistician currently working as a Junior Research Group Leader for
Bayesian Statistics at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech, University of
Stuttgart. I am interested in a wide range of research topics most of which
involve the development, evaluation, implementation, or application of Bayesian
methods. See [here](../publications) for an overview of my scientific
publications. You can also find me on
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JSj6m1IAAAAJ&hl). I am
deeply involved in open-source software development and you can find my
major open-source contributions below. Originally, I have studied Psychology and
Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen and did my PhD in Münster
on Optimal Design and Bayesian Data Analysis. Before starting my own research
group in Stuttgart, I have worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department
of Computer Science at Aalto University.
