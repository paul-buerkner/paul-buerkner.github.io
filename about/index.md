I am a Ph.D. statistician currently working at Aalto University
(Finland), Department of Computer Science. I am the author of the R package
[brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and member of the
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) Development Team. Previously, I have studied
Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen. See
[here](../publications) for an overview of my scientific publications.
