In addition to doing research and managing a lab, I am deeply involved in 
open source software development. While I mostly program in R myself,
my lab uses a flexible combination of R, Python, and C++. I also hope
to add Julia to the list soon. Below, you can find an overview of my most
important open source software contributions.

**brms** is an R package to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear
multilevel models using [**Stan**](#stan). The formula syntax provides a
powerful combination of intuitiveness and flexibility. A wide range of response
distributions are supported, allowing users to fit many differents kinds of
models including linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times,
ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel
context. Further modeling options include theory- and data-driven
non-linear functions, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value
imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response
distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression.
Multivariate models (i.e., models with multiple response variables) can be fit
as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to
apply prior distributions that actually reflect their knowledge. Model fit can
easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks,
cross-validation, and Bayes factors.

**Stan**  is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and 
high-performance statistical computation. Thousands of users rely on Stan for
statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in the social, biological, 
and physical sciences, engineering, and business.
Users specify log density functions in Stan’s probabilistic programming language
and get full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling as well as access
to other inference algorithms. Stan’s math library provides differentiable
probability functions & linear algebra (C++ autodiff). Additional R packages
provide expression-based linear modeling, posterior visualization, Bayesian
cross-validation, and much more.

Stan interfaces with the most popular data analysis languages (R, Python, Julia)
as well as the command line. It runs on all major platforms (Linux, Mac,
Windows). Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software (new BSD core, some
interfaces GPLv3).  Stan is associated with [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a
nonprofit supporting open code and reproducible science, through which you can
help support Stan.

BayesFlow: Simulation-Based Bayesian Inference

**BayesFlow** is a Python library for efficient simulation-based Bayesian
Inference. It enables users to create specialized neural networks for amortized
Bayesian inference, which repays users with rapid statistical inference after a
potentially longer simulation-based training phase. A cornerstone idea of
amortized Bayesian inference is to employ generative neural networks for
parameter estimation, model comparison, and model validation when working with
intractable simulators whose behavior as a whole is too complex to be described
analytically.

Both the BayesFlow library itself and its community are quickly growing. Our
goal is to make it the gold-standard simulation-based inference library
within the next couple of years.
